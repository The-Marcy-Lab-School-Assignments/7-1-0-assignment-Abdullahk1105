# Question

When should Context be used?

# Answer

Context should be used when you want to pass data into from a component into another component, you would use context when you want to avoid prop drilling. Prop drilling is when you pass data from one component into every nested component to reach your goal component. We want to avoid prop drilling because as our component tree becomes bigger the code is going to be harder to read and understand.
