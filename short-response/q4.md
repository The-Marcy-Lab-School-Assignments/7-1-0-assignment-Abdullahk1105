# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InstagramContext from "./InstagramContext";

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
  const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

  const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

  return (
    <InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
      {children}
    </InstagramContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```

# Answer

The `children` in the `InstagramContextProvider` will be `App` because this component has access to every other component in out website, so if this component is wrapped in `InstagramContextProvider` we know that our context will be global and can be used any where in our webseite.

2/3 points
This answer is correct in identifying that the InstagramContextProvider will likely be wrapped around the App component to make the context values accessible throughout the application. However, it's important to note that this would typically happen in the main.jsx. A bit more specificity would make your answer stronger.
